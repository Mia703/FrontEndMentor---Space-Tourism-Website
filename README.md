## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the desktop layout for each of the website's pages
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Links

- [Live Site](https://mia703.github.io/FrontEndMentor---Space-Tourism-Website/)

## My process

I started off with building the landing page first and then branching my way out to the other pages. I then completed the Destinations pages. After completing the layout and styling of the Destination pages, I linked the other pages to that same CSS file so that all Destination pages had the same style. I did the same for the following menu items. 

### Built with

This site was built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

From this project, I got a better understanding of CSS layout and text styling works. This is my first project, so I was focused on getting the HTML elements in the correct location on the page rather than the page's responsiveness. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I will focus on the responsiveness first. I will start buliding the page's tablet version first before working on the desktop version.
